Create a CMake file
Now you have to create your CMakeLists.txt file. It should look like this:

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)
project( DisplayImage )
find_package( OpenCV REQUIRED )
include_directories( ${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS} )
add_executable( DisplayImage DisplayImage.cpp )
target_link_libraries( DisplayImage ${OpenCV_LIBS} )

Generate the executable
This part is easy, just proceed as with any other project using CMake:

cd <DisplayImage_directory>
cmake .
make

Result
By now you should have an executable (called DisplayImage in this case). You just have to run it giving an image location as an argument, i.e.:

./DisplayImage lena.jpg
